What's the difference between fetch & pull?
pull is a two step process (fetch + merge)
Will not be able to push if you haven't gotten the latest updates from your remote
fetch - asking for the updates, but not merging them into your local branch
When you add upstream remote, you have to explicitly tell remote to do things. Otherwise, git assumes you are only working with master

vi is a modal editor
j moves your cursor down
k moves your cursor up
l is right
h is left
(If you don't have arrows)
:q! enter (quit without saving)
vi is a powerful editor with a steep beginning learning curve
